When we compile our document, we are using the `R Markdown` package.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Insert text with some footnotes

Footnote ref [^1] and another one [^longnote]

[^1]: Footnote1
[^longnote]: Footnote long

## Insert Tables

```{r }
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

## Insert images

## Insert animated GIF and videos

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(pressure)
```
